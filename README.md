Getting and Cleaning Data

This is the repo for Getting and Cleaning Data on Coursera.org

The R script run_analysis.r requires the Samsung data to work. 
Samsung data can be downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
Once downloaded, unzip the file and copy the directory "UCI HAR Dataset" into your home directory.

Copy the run_analysis.r script into the same directory where the folder "UCI HAR Dataset" is.  
Set the working directory for the R script to be the directory where you have copied it into.
